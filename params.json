{"name":"Overview of my work","tagline":"","body":"**This page is still under construction. Not all the projects have been listed here. A lot more will come.**\r\n\r\n### Welcome\r\nYou will find here several projects that I have developed throughout the last years. Most of them have been developed during my studies at [EPITECH](http://www.epitech.eu/). In order to get a better overview, I will chronologically sort them per school year.\r\n\r\n### First year (2010-2011)\r\n\r\n* [alumn-1](http://gregoireborel.github.io/alumn-1/) - Nim game in C\r\n* [minitalk](http://gregoireborel.github.io/minitalk/) - Client-server program in C\r\n* [get_next_line](http://gregoireborel.github.io/get_next_line/) - Function that returns a line read in a file descriptor\r\n* [42sh](http://gregoireborel.github.io/42sh/) - POSIX Shell developed in C\r\n\r\n### Second year (2011-2012)\r\n\r\n* [Nibbler](http://gregoireborel.github.io/nibbler/) - \r\n* [Bomberman](http://gregoireborel.github.io/bomberman/) - \r\n* [Trade](http://gregoireborel.github.io/trade/) - \r\n\r\n### Third year (2012-2013)\r\n\r\n* [BabyMeatZombies]( http://gregoireborel.github.io/BabyMeatZombies) - A 2D zombie game in C# using XNA 4.0\r\n* [Gomoku]( http://gregoireborel.github.io/gomoku) - Gomoku game in C#\r\n\r\n### Fourth year (2013-2014)\r\nThis year was a special one. We had the obligation to spend the year abroad. I chose Ireland and thus went to Dublin from September 2013 to May 2014. While over there, I studied at the [Griffith Dublin College](http://www.griffith.ie/) (and also drank a lot of beer) and practiced my English. However, I still learnt new things. Here is a non-exhaustive list of modules in which I participated:\r\n\r\n* Data Structure and Algorithms (Java)\r\n* Programming Paradigms (Scala)\r\n* Distributed Systems (C++)\r\n* Game Design (study of gameplay mechanisms)\r\n* HCI and GUI Programming (Java SWING)\r\n    * [Chess game](http://gregoireborel.github.io/chess) -  Chess game in Java\r\n* Web Frameworks (Rails)\r\n    * [FakeBook](http://gregoireborel.github.io/FakeBook) - A very tiny social network written with Rails\r\n* Emerging Technologies (Android)\r\n    * [GPS Tracker](http://gregoireborel.github.io/GPSTracker) - Android application that tracks and stores user's location, distance, speed and time\r\n\r\nI also continued to work on my studies final project.\r\n\r\n### Fifth year (2014-2015)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n* [My resume](https://github.com/gregoireborel/resume/blob/master/resume-gregoire-borel.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm a french student in fifth year at EPITECH. I'm passionate about science in general and would like to find a work in a field that could mix my computing skills within a scientific background. I'm especially thinking about the aerospace and robotics technologies.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
